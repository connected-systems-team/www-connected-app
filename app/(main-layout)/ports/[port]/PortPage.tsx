                        Since HTTP traffic on Port 80 is not encrypted, it is susceptible to eavesdropping and
                        man-in-the-middle attacks. It&apos;s recommended to use HTTPS on Port 443 for secure
                        communication.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3>Origin and Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Port 80 was officially assigned to HTTP by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). HTTP was
                        developed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
                    </p>

                    <p>who claimed the port, when, why, and what is their picture?</p>

                    <p>is it a well-known port and what does that mean?</p>

                    <h3>Significant Events</h3>
                    <p>
                        The introduction of HTTP/1.0 in 1996 standardized web communications. In 1999, HTTP/1.1 brought
                        performance improvements. The 2015 introduction of HTTP/2 improved efficiency, and HTTP/3
                        (introduced in 2020) further optimized performance and security.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Adoption and Usage</h3>
                    <p>
                        Port 80 became the standard due to its early adoption and widespread use in web browsers and
                        servers. The shift towards HTTPS (Port 443) has been driven by security concerns and initiatives
                        like Let&apos;s Encrypt.
